# Connecta

Connecta is an open-source project developed as part of a master thesis in the field of IoT connectivity. The project provides multi-protocol IoT connectivity for nRF devices using MQTT, and supports two mesh networking protocols: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and OpenThread. With Connecta, you can easily connect your nRF devices to MQTT brokers, enabling secure and reliable communication with other devices and cloud services.

## Getting Started

To use Connecta in your project, you'll need an nRF device and a few additional components:

- A BLE or OpenThread-capable nRF device
- A compatible MQTT broker (such as Mosquitto)
- A Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection to your MQTT broker

Once you have these components, you can download the Connecta source code from GitHub and build it for your nRF device. Follow the instructions in the [documentation](./docs/index.md) to get started.

## Features

Connecta provides the following features:

- Support for BLE and OpenThread mesh networking protocols
- Easy integration with MQTT brokers
- Secure communication using TLS/SSL
- Efficient use of system resources
- Lightweight and customizable for embedded systems
